'Get Shit Done' kit is a beautiful resource built for Bootstrap. We have redesigned all its components to make it look flat, minimalist and easy to use. We are proud of this new Bootstrap skin and the possibilities for customisation.

Using it is very simple and it will enable you to refresh you classic looking application. To get the desired effect you will also need to integrate JS plugins that take a little bit more effort. It the end the result will be worth it.

The 'Get Shit Done' kit is built on top of Bootstrap 3, so you can safely use it on your existing or new Bootstrap project. No line of code from Bootstrap 3 was changed, so you don't have to worry about undesired effects in your work.            We provide all the necessary CSS resources. To get going, just include 'css/get-shit-done.css' in your HTML template. Your project will get the new look.

The easiest way to start is to use our start-up template where all the files are already included and ready to use.
